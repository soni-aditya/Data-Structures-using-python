#### What is a Complete Binary Tree?
A complete binary tree is a special type of binary tree where all the levels of the tree are filled completely except the lowest level nodes which are filled from as left as possible.

#### Properties of Complete Binary Tree:
- A complete binary tree is said to be a proper binary tree where all leaves have the same depth.
- In a complete binary tree number of nodes at depth d is 2d. 
- In a  complete binary tree with n nodes height of the tree is log(n+1).
- All the levels except the last level are completely full.

#### Perfect Binary Tree vs Complete Binary Tree:
- A binary tree of height ‘h’ having the maximum number of nodes is a perfect binary tree. 
For a given height h, the maximum number of nodes is [2^(h+1)]-1.

- A complete binary tree of height h is a proper binary tree up to height h-1, and in the last level element are stored in left to right order.
