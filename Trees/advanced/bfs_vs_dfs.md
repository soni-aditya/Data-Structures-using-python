### What are BFS and DFS for Binary Tree? 

A Tree is typically traversed in two ways:

- Breadth First Traversal (Or Level Order Traversal)
- Depth First Traversals
    - Inorder Traversal (Left-Root-Right)
    - Preorder Traversal (Root-Left-Right)
    - Postorder Traversal (Left-Right-Root)

BFS and DFSs of above Tree

**Breadth First Traversal :** 1 2 3 4 5 or 1 2 3 5 4 or 1 3 2 4 5 or 1 3 2 5 4 

**Depth First Traversals:** 
- Preorder Traversal : 1 2 4 5 3 
- Inorder Traversal  :  4 2 5 1 3 
- Postorder Traversal : 4 5 2 3 1

### Is there any difference in terms of Time Complexity?

**All four traversals require O(n) time as they visit every node exactly once.** 

### Is there any difference in terms of Extra Space? 

There is surely difference in terms of extra space required.

- Extra Space required for Level Order Traversal(breadth first traversal) is O(w) where w is maximum width of Binary Tree. In level order traversal, queue one by one stores nodes of different level.
- Extra Space required for Depth First Traversals is O(h) where h is maximum height of Binary Tree. In Depth First Traversals, stack (or function call stack) stores all ancestors of a node.

Maximum Width of a Binary Tree at depth (or height) h can be 2h where h starts from 0. So the maximum number of nodes can be at the last level. And worst case occurs when Binary Tree is a perfect Binary Tree with numbers of nodes like 1, 3, 7, 15, â€¦etc. In worst case, value of 2^h is **Ceil(n/2)**.


Height for a Balanced Binary Tree is O(Log n). Worst case occurs for skewed tree and worst case height becomes O(n). So in worst case extra space required is O(n) for both. But worst cases occur for different types of trees. 

**It is evident from above points that extra space required for Level order traversal(BFS) is likely to be more when tree is more balanced and extra space for Depth First Traversal(DFS) is likely to be more when tree is less balanced. How to Pick One?**
