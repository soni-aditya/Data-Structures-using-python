'''
Given a singly linked list, rotate the linked list counter-clockwise by k nodes. Where k is a given positive integer. For example, if the given linked list is 10->20->30->40->50->60 and k is 4, the list should be modified to 50->60->10->20->30->40. Assume that k is smaller than the count of nodes in a linked list.
'''

'''
To rotate a linked list by k, we can first make the linked list as circular and then moving k-1 steps forward from head node, making (k-1)th nodeâ€™s next to null and make kth node as head.
